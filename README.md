A BMI calculator app helps users quickly determine their body mass index by entering their weight and height. It calculates 
the BMI, indicating if the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This simple tool 
assists users in assessing their health and fitness levels, 
encouraging them to take steps towards maintaining or achieving a healthy weight.

A True/False quiz app presents users with a series of questions, each with two possible answers: true or false. The user selects 
one of the options for each question. After answering all the questions, the quiz restarts, allowing the user to try again. This simple 
format makes it easy to test knowledge 
on various topics and provides immediate feedback by letting users retake the quiz as many times as they like.
