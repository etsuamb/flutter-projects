A BMI calculator app helps users quickly determine their body mass index by entering their weight and height. It calculates 
the BMI, indicating if the user is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. This simple tool 
assists users in assessing their health and fitness levels, 
encouraging them to take steps towards maintaining or achieving a healthy weight.

A True/False quiz app presents users with a series of questions, each with two possible answers: true or false. The user selects 
one of the options for each question. After answering all the questions, the quiz restarts, allowing the user to try again. This simple 
format makes it easy to test knowledge 
on various topics and provides immediate feedback by letting users retake the quiz as many times as they like.

A weather app prompts users to enter the capital city of a specific country. The app then responds with the current temperature in Celsius
and displays an emoji that corresponds to the weather conditions. 
This interactive and visual approach makes it easy for users to get quick and intuitive updates on the weather in different capitals around the world.
